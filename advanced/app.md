# AstroPixelsPlus

The AstroPixels Plus firmware is a third party one created by Mimir who also did the main ReelTwo library that the Astropixels are based on.

It adds various options such as a web connection to use a mobile phone app, serial communications for triggering effects, and servo control for HPs and dome.
