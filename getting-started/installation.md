# Installation

The Astropixel kit is designed to fit into the same surrounds as the old teecees lights with the same mounting holes. 

## Main Board

The main breakout board can be mounted on the back of the RLD with long enough screws and some spacers. This is probably the best/easiest mounting option and the cables supplied are designed around it being in this position

## Bezels

Here is a pdf to be used with a cnc or laser cutter to make some acrylic bezels and front covers for the logics

## Spacers

Here are a collection of STL files to 3d print for spacing the boards out from the surrounds and clear front cover. Along with 3d printable bezels.
