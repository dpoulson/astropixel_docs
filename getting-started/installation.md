# Installation

The Astropixel kit is designed to fit into the same surrounds as the old teecees lights with the same mounting holes. 

## Main Board

The main breakout board can be mounted on the back of the RLD with long enough screws and some spacers. This is probably the best/easiest mounting option and the cables supplied are designed around it being in this position
