# Quickstart

First step is to check the [Kit contents](kit_contents.md) to make sure nothing is missing, and to familiarise yourself with the terminology used.

# Wiring Up

Breakout board -> RLD = 1 x 10cm
Breakout board -> FLD = 1 x 30cm extension + 1 x 10cm
FLD -> FLD = 1 x 10cm
Breakout board -> FPSI = 1 x 30cm extension + 1 x 20cm
Breakout board -> RPSI = 1 x 30cm
Breakout board -> THP = 1 x 30cm extension + 1 x 10cm
Breakout board -> RHP = 1 x 20cm
Breakout board -> FHP = 1 x 30cm extension + 1 x 30cm

# First Power

{% hint style="warning" %}
Whilst it is fine to use the USB connector for initial testing, they are fragile so shouldn't be used in a final install.

Beautiful documentation starts with the content you create â€” and GitBook makes it easy to get started with any pre-existing content.



### Import

GitBook supports importing content from many popular writing tools and formats. If your content already exists, you can upload a file or group of files to be imported.

### Sync a repository

GitBook also allows you to set up a bi-directional sync with an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab. Setting up Git Sync allows you and your team to write content in GitBook or in code, and never have to worry about your content becoming out of sync.
