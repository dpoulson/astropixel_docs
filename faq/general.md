## Why did you create the Astropixels?
Initially to just have a go at designing PCBs. I did the first PSIs and got them manufactured by JLCPCB and realised how easy it was and also just how cheap I could make them if ordering in bulk. So I did the rest of the dome light boards, using the ReelTwo library and the Astropixels were born. It was also a way to give people an upgrade that is both better and cheaper than the common teecees lights that are using very old tech. You can see a comparison of them here.
## How long did it take?
It took me a couple of months and a number of failed attempts to get the first batch made that I sold to some beta testers in the UK. I then started ramping up the production numbers, with a few tweaks to the design until about a year later I had what is now the current version.
## Why so cheap?
I get a lot of people asking this, and the answer is that I’m doing this for the love of the club. I’ve taken a lot from other members over the years with all the information and parts that they willingly share so I thought it was time to return the favour for the new people in the club. I don’t aim to make any money from this, so apart from making sure I’ve enough spares and that I’m not out of pocket I will keep the price as cheap as possible.
