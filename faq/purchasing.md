## Can I just send you the money rather than going through your store?
Short answer is no. Using the store lets me keep track of things and makes sure that I don’t miss an order or similar. It also allows me to see the numbers sold and predict when I need to order the next batch. Plus I also then know how much I need to give to charity.
## Before I pay, do you still sell them?
If there is stock in the store, then I have sets more or less ready to ship. At the very least I have enough tested boards ready to be packed up. As per builders club rules, I cannot take pre payments or anything like that. I can only accept money when I have the items in hand.
## Why can I only buy one set at once?
Initially it was because I was only doing smaller runs and wanted to make sure as many people got them as possible. Now I’ve aways got stock I’m very wary of people buying multiple sets with the intention of building droids for sale (this is against club rules). If you want more than one set, feel free to drop me a line. If you don’t communicate with me, I’ll cancel any extra orders.
## Do you ship to <x>?
I will ship anywhere that the [Royal Mail](https://www.royalmail.com/) allow. However, not all places may be set up on the store so if you can’t select your address, drop me a line and I’ll add it.
## Can I just buy some of the boards
Unfortunately I can't. As I buy them in batches this would leave me with certain boards in stock that would never shift. I just sell the kits as is.
## Can I have a tracking number?
Initially, no orders were sent with tracking numbers. However I am adding the option to more and more locations. Make sure to select the tracked option when ordering.
## I’ve just got a customs charge?
This is down to your own country and I have no control over it. Any package going overseas from the UK will have a customs form on the back stating the price of the contents. On entering your country they may charge you import fees. This is just something to bear in mind when ordering.
## Can you put a lower price on the customs form to save me money?
No, this is illegal.
## Which charity do you donate to and why?
One of the things I love about the community is the charity work done, so when I put the Astropixels up for sale I decided that £10 from each purchase would go to the [Droidbuilders UK](https://droidbuilders.uk/charity) chosen charity. Currently as of September 2024 that is [Alzheimer's Society](www.alzheimers.org.uk) but we’ve supported many other causes over the years such as [Make a Wish](https://www.make-a-wish.org.uk/), [MNDA](https://www.mndassociation.org/), [Calm](https://www.thecalmzone.net/), and [Meningitis Now](https://www.meningitisnow.org/).
