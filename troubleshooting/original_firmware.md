# Original Firmware

If you have been messing with the firmware and want to go back to the basics, the example astropixels sketch in the ReelTwo library is what is installed by default when they are shipped.

Mimir has also provided a handy tool to flash either the Astropixels Plus firmware via a browser, or the original firmware
